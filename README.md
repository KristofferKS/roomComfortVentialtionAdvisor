## Development Rules

### Data Management
- **Local Data Only**: When creating folders for storing data, do **NOT** create them inside this repository.
- Data must be stored locally on your machine (outside the project directory) to prevent accidental uploads to GitHub.

## Project Structure
- `Mini-project/`: Project files
